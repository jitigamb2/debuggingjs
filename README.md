# Debugging JavaScript - A Journey Into the Unknown

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains all the slides and code related to my talk **Debugging JavaScript - A Journey Into the Unknown**.

## Slides

To run the slides locally you just need to run `npm run slides`. Or you can see a non interactive version of them in `slides/slides.md`.

The slides are powered by [Reveal.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal) and [reveal-md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal-md).

## Versions

I've given this talk a few times and will keep track of all available recordings below.
