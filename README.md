## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

This repo contains all the slides and code related to my talk **Debugging JavaScript - A Journey Into the Unknown**.

## Slides

To run the slides locally you just need to run `npm run slides`.<br>
Or you can see a non interactive version of them in `slides/slides.md`.

The slides are powered by [Reveal.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal) and [reveal-md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reveal-md).
